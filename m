Yeah, I've gotten conflicting feedback on treewide changes:
- please CC me on only the one patch, I don't want to see everything else
- please CC me on the whole series, I want the full context for the change

I opted toward "CC me on this series", but then I get stuck when the CC
is giant. I think I may switch back to individual CCs for specific
patches, and point people to lore if they want greater context. (lore
didn't exist before...)

Thanks for the poke to make me reconsider this workflow. :)
